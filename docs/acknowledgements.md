VIAME was originally developed with funding from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Fisheries Strategic
Initiative on Automated Image Analysis (AIASI) committee.

Following initial development, it has been aided by a number of support
contracts for feature development, by both government laboratories (NOAA AKFSC
Marine Mammals Lab, Ifremer, US Department of Energy), alongside non-profits
such as the Coonamessett Farm Foundation (CFF).

Additional thanks goes to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)
RY and RI divisions, with some features developed across SBIRS/STTRS
(e.g. PR# 88ABW-2019-4904) in addition to other government and commercial
partners who have funded different components and tookits which VIAME
uses.
