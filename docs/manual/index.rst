VIAME
=====

Video and Image Analytics for Multiple Environments (`VIAME`_) is a computer vision application
designed for do-it-yourself artificial intelligence including object detection, object tracking,
image/video annotation, image/video search, image mosaicing, image enhancement, size measurement,
multi-camera data processing, rapid model generation, and tools for the evaluation of different
algorithms. Originally targetting marine species analytics, VIAME now contains many common
algorithms and libraries, and is also useful as a generic computer vision toolkit.
It contains a number of standalone tools for accomplishing the above, a pipeline framework
which can connect C/C++, python, and matlab nodes together in a multi-threaded fashion, and
multiple algorithms resting on top of the pipeline infrastructure. Lastly, a portion of the
algorithms have been integrated into both desktop and web user interfaces for deployments in
different types of environments, with an open annotation archive and example of the web
platform available at `viame.kitware.com`_.
