# IFREMER

This package contains IFREMER's specific VIAME tools and configuration.

IFREMER (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) is a French
oceanographic research institute that focuses on studying the oceans and their
resources.

This package was initialy created in the context of the Game of Trawls 
project which aims to develop new technologies for sustainable fishing. 

The project is a partnership between IFREMER, Marport France,
UMR IRISA (Institute of Research in Computer Science and Random Systems - UMR 6074) and
the Departmental Committee for Maritime Fisheries and Marine Farms of Morbihan (CDPMEM 56).
The project proposes several approaches, including real-time measurement of the impact of
fishing gear using a sensor network and computer vision to detect and identify species that 
enter the fishing gear in real-time.
