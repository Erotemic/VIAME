Video and Image Search Examples
===============================

********
Overview
********

This document corresponds to the `search and rapid model generation`_ folder contained within a VIAME
desktop installation. This directory contains methods to accomplish two tasks: 

| (a) Performing exemplar-based searches on an archive of unannotated imagery or videos 
| (b) Quickly training up detection models for new categories of objects on the same ingest

Video and Image Archive Search using VIAME
==========================================

Video archive search can be performed via a few methods. The default includes
a pipeline which generates object detections, tracks, and lastly temporal
descriptors around each track. The descriptors get indexed into an arbitrary
data store (typically a nearest neighbor index, locality-sensitive hashing
table, or other). At query time, descriptors on a query image or video are
matched against the entries in this database. A default GUI (provided via
the VIVIA toolkit) is provided which allows performing iterative refinement
of the results, by annotating which were correct or incorrect, in order
to build up a better model for the input query. This model can be for
a new object category (or sub-category attribute) and saved to an output file
to be reused again in future pipelines or query requests. Input regions to 
query against can either be full frame descriptors, around just object detections,
or, lastly, object tracks.


Initial Setup
=============

| Building and running this example requires either a VIAME install or a build from source with: 
|
|  (a) The python packages: numpy, pymongo, torch, torchvision, matplotlib, and python-tk
|  (b) A VIAME build with VIAME_ENABLE_SMQTK, YOLO, OPENCV, PYTORCH, VXL, and VIVIA enabled.
|
First, you should decide where you want to run this example from. Doing it in the example folder
tree is fine as a first pass, but if it is something you plan on running a few times or on multiple
datasets, you probably want to select a different place in your user space to store generated
databases and model files. This can be accomplished by making a new folder in your directory
and either copying the scripts (.sh, .bat) from this example into this new directory, or via
copying the project files located in [VIAME-INSTALL]/configs/prj-linux (or prj-windows) to this
new directory. After copying these scripts to the directory you want to run them from, you may need
to make sure the first line in the top, "VIAME_INSTALL", points to the location
of your VIAME installation (as shown below) if your installation is in a non-default directory, or
you copied the example files elsewhere. If using windows, all '.sh' scripts in the below will
be '.bat' scripts that you should be able to just double-click to run.

Ingest Image or Video Data
==========================

First, create_index.[type].sh should be called to initialize a new database, and populate it
with descriptors generated around generic objects to be queried upon. Here, [type] can either
be 'around_detections', 'detection_and_tracking', or 'full_frame_only', depending on if you want
to run matching on spatio-temporal object tracks, object detections, or full frames respectively
(see VIAME quick start guide). If you want to run it on a custom selection of images, make a file
list of images called 'input_list.txt' containing your images, one per line. For example, if you
have a folder containing png images, run 'ls [folder]/*.png > input_list.txt' on the command line
to make this list. Alternatively, if ingesting videos, make a directory called 'videos' which contains
all of your .mpg, .avi, .etc videos. If you look in the ingest scripts, you can see links to these
sources if you wish to change them. Next run the ingest script, as below.

   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_1_ingest.png

This should take a little bit if the process is successful, see below. If you already have a
database present in your folder it will ask you if you want to remove it.

   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_2_ingest.png

If your ingest was successful, you should get a message saying 'ingest complete" with no
errors in your output log. If you get an error, and are unable to decipher it, send a copy
of your database/Logs folder and console output to 'viame.developers@gmail.com'.


Perform an Image Query
======================

After performing an ingest 'bash launch_search_interface.sh' should be called to launch the GUI.

.. image:: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_3_launch_gui.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_3_launch_gui.png

| In this example, we will first start with an image query.
| 
| Select, in the top left, Query -> New
|
| From the Query Type drop down, select Image Exemplar
|
Next select an image to use as an exemplar of what you are looking for. This image can
take one of two forms, either a large image containing many objects including your
object of interest, or a cropped out version of your object.

.. image:: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_4_new_query.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_4_new_query.png

Whatever image you give, the system will generate a full-frame descriptor for your entire
image alongside sub-detections on regions smaller than the full image.

.. image:: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_5_query_result.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_5_query_result.png

Select the box you are most interested in.

   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_6_select_fish.png

Press the down arrow to highlight it (the selected box should light up in green). Press okay
on the bottom right, then okay again on the image query panel to perform the query.

Optionally, the below four instructions are an aside on how to generate an image chip just
showing your object of interest. They can be ignored if you don't need them. If the default
object proposal techniques are not generating boxes around your object for a full frame, you
can use this method then select the full frame descriptor around the object. In the below
we used the free GIMP painter tool to crop out a chip. Install this  using 'sudo apt-get
install gimp', on Ubuntu, https://www.gimp.org/ on Windows).

   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_7_crop_fish.png

Right click on your image in your file browser, select 'Edit with Gimp', press Ctrl-C to
open the above dialogue, highlight the region of interest, press enter to crop.

   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_8_cropped_fish.png

Save out your crop to wherever you want, preferably somewhere near your project folder.

   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_9_select_fish_again.png

Now you can put this chip through the image query system, instead of the full frame one.

   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_10_initial_results.png

Regardless which method you use, when you get new results they should look like this. You
can select them on the left and see the entries on the right. Your GUI may not look like this
depending on which windows you have turned on, but different display windows can be enabled
or disabled in Settings->Tool Views and dragged around the screen.

.. image:: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_11_initial_results.png

   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_11_initial_results.png

Results can be exported by highlighting entries and selecting Query -> Export Results in the
default VIAME csv format and others. You can show multiple entries at the same time by highlighting
them all (hold shift, press the first entry then the last), right-clicking on them, and going
to 'Show Selected Entries'.

Train a IQR Model
=================

.. image:: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_12_adjudacation.png

When you perform an initial query, you can annotate results as to their correct-ness in order
to generate a model for said query concept. This can be accomplished via a few key-presses.
Either right click on an individual result and select the appropriate option, or highlight
an entry and press '+' or '-' on your keyboard for faster annotation.

.. image:: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_13_feedback.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_13_feedback.png

You might want to annotate entries from both the top results list, and the requested
feedback list (bottom left in the above). This can improve the performance of your
model significantly. After annotating your entries press 'Refine' on the top left.

   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_14_next_n_results.png

There we go, that's a little better isn't it.

Okay these guys are a little weird, but nothing another round of annotations can't fix.

After you're happy with your models, you should export them (Query -> Export IQR Model) to
a directory called 'category_models' in your project folder for re-use on both new and larger
datasets.

.. image:: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_17_saved_models.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_17_saved_models.png

The category models directory should contain only .svm model files.

Re-Run Models on Additional Data
================================

If you have one or more .svm model files in your category_models folder, you can run the
'bash process_list_using_models.sh' script in your project folder. This can either be on
the same data you just processed, or new data. By default, this script consumes the supplied
input_list.txt and produces a detection file called 'svm_detections.csv' containing a probability
for each input model in the category_models directory per detection. Alternatively this pipeline,
this can be run from `within the annotation GUI`_.

.. image:: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_18_produced_detections.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center
   :target: http://www.viametoolkit.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iqr_18_produced_detections.png

The resultant detection .csv file is in the same common format that most other examples in VIAME
take. You can load this detection file up in the annotation GUI and select a detection threshold
for your newly-trained detector, `see here`_. You can use these models on any imagery, it doesn't
need to be the same imagery you trained it on.

Correct Results and Train a Better Model
========================================

If you have a detection .csv file for corresponding imagery, and want to train a better (deep)
model for the data, you can first correct any mistakes (either mis-classifications,
grossly incorrect boxes, or missed detections) in the annotation GUI. To do this, set a detection
threshold you want to annotate at, do not change it, and make the boxes as perfect as possible
at this threshold. Over-ride any incorrectly computed classification types, and create new
detections for objects which were missed by the initial model. Export a new detection csv
(File->Export Tracks) after correcting as many boxes as you can. Lastly, feed this into the
ground-up `detector training example`_. Make sure to set whatever threshold you set for annotation
in the [train].sh script you use for new model training.
