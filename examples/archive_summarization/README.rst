Archive Summarization
=====================

This document corresponds to the `Archive Summarization`_ example folder within a VIAME
desktop installation. This example covers scripts which simultaneously create a searchable
index of video archive and plots detailing different organism counts over time. The
'summarize_and_index_videos' script performs both of these tasks, while the
'summarize_videos' script only performs the later. Plots are generated, for each video,
in the 'database' output folder, and can alternatively be viewed by the 'launch_timeline_viewer'
script. Queries can be performed via the 'launch_search_interface' script, in a fashion
similar to both the 'search_and_rapid_model_generation' example in 'search_and_rapid_model_generation'
and in the binary install guide.
