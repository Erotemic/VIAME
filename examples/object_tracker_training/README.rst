Object Tracker Training
=======================

********
Overview
********

This document corresponds to the `object tracker training`_ example within a VIAME
desktop installation folder.

.. _object detector training: https://github.com/VIAME/VIAME/tree/master/examples/object_tracker_training

Object tracker training can be performed in a similar way to `object detection training`_,
via formatting the directory structure in the same format and launching the train script. Unlike
detection no labels.txt file is necessary, and by default, all images will be used to train
updated tracking models. The necessary format is:

| [root_training_dir] (default: training_data)
| ...folder1
| ......image001.png
| ......image002.png
| ......image003.png
| ......groundtruth.csv
| ...folder2
| ......image001.png
| ......image002.png
| ......groundtruth.csv
| ...etc...
|
