This document corresponds to the 'Object Detection'_ folder within a VIAME Desktop
installation. This folder contains assorted examples of object detection pipelines
running different detectors such as YOLO, Faster RCNN, ScallopTK, and others.
Several different models are found in the examples, trained on a variety of
different sensors. It can be useful to try out different models to see what works
best for your problem.

*********************************
Running the Command Line Examples
*********************************

Each run script contains 2 calls. A first ('source setup_viame.sh') which
runs a script configuring all paths required to run VIAME calls, and a second
to 'kwiver runner' running the desired detection pipeline. For more information
about pipeline configuration, see the pipeline examples. Each example processes
a list of images and produces detections in various format as output, as configured
in the pipeline files.

Each pipeline contains 2-10 nodes, including a imagery source, in this case an image
list loader, the actual detector, detection filters, and detection writers. In the
habcam example an additional split processes is added early in the pipeline, as
habcam imagery has stereo pairs typically encoded in the same png.

***************************
Running Examples in the GUI
***************************

The annotation GUI can also be used to run object detector or tracking pipelines. To
accomplish this, load imagery using the `annotation gui`_, then select Tools -> Execute Pipeline
and select a pipeline to run, see below. Special notes: the 'habcam' pipeline only processes
the left sides of images, assuming that the image contains side-by-side stereo pairs, and
the 'svm' pipeline requires '.svm' model files to exist in a 'category_models' directory
from where the GUI is run. New pipelines can be added to the GUI by adding them to the
default pipelines folder, with the word 'embedded' in them by default.

These are the build flags required to run these examples, if building from
the source. In the pre-built binaries they are all enabled by default.

| Minimum:
|
| VIAME_ENABLE_OPENCV (default) (for image reading) or alternatively VIAME_ENABLE_VXL if
| you set :image_reader:type to vxl in each .pipe config.
|
| Per-Example:
|
| run_habcam - VIAME_ENABLE_OPENCV, VIAME_ENABLE_DARKNET, VIAME_ENABLE_SCALLOP_TK
| run_scallop_tk - VIAME_ENABLE_SCALLOP_TK
| run_yolo - VIAME_ENABLE_DARKNET
| run_lanl - VIAME_ENABLE_MATLAB


*******************************
Running Detectors From C++ Code
*******************************

We will be using a Hough circle detector as an and example of the
mechanics of implementing a VIAME detector in cxx code.

In general, detectors accept images and produce detections. The data
types that we will need to get data in and out of the detector are
implemented in the Vital portion of KWIVER. For this detector, we will
be using an `image_container` to hold the input image and a
`detected_object_set` to hold the detected objects. We will look at how
these data types behave a little later.

Vital provides an algorithm to load an image. We will use this to get
the images for the detector. The `image_io` algorithm provides a
method that accepts a file name and returns an image.

::

  kwiver::vital::image_container_sptr load(std::string const& filename) const;

Now that we have an image, we can pass it to the detector using the following method on
`hough_circle_detector` and get a list of detections.

::

  virtual vital::detected_object_set_sptr detect( vital::image_container_sptr image_data ) const;


The detections, for example, can be drawn on the original image to see
how well the detector is performing.

The following program implements a simple single object detector.

::

  #include <arrows/ocv/image_container.h>
  #include <arrows/ocv/image_io.h>
  #include <arrows/ocv/hough_circle_detector.h>

  #include <string>

  int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
  {
    // get file name for input image
    std::string filename = argv[1];

    // create image reader
    kwiver::vital::algo::image_io_sptr image_reader( new kwiver::arrows::ocv::image_io() );

    // Read the image
    kwiver::vital::image_container_sptr the_image = image_reader->load( filename );

    // Create the detector
    kwiver::vital::algo::image_object_detector_sptr detector( new kwiver::arrows::ocv::hough_circle_detector() );

    // Send image to detector and get detections.
    kwiver::vital::detected_object_set_sptr detections = detector->detect( the_image );

    // See what was detected
    std::cout << "There were " << detections->size() << " detections in the image." << std::endl;

    return 0;
  }

This sample program implements the essential steps of a detector.

Now that we have a simple program running, there are two concepts that
are supported by vital that are essential for building larger
applications; logging and configuration support.

*******
Logging
*******

Vital provides logging support through macros that are used in the
code to format and display informational messages. The following piece
of code implements a logger and generates a message.

::

  // Include the logger interface
  #include <vital/logger/logger.h>

  // get a logger or logging object
  kwiver::vital::logger_handle_t logger( kwiver::vital::get_logger( "test_logger" ));

  float data;

  // log a message
  LOG_ERROR( logger, "Message " << data );


The vital logger is similar to most loggers in that it needs logging
object to provide context for the log message. Each logger object has
an associated name that can be used to when configuring what logging
output should be displayed. The default logger does not provide any
logger output control, but there are optional logging providers which
do.

There are logging macros that produce a message with an associated
severity, error, warning, info, debug, trace. The log text can be
specified as an output stream expression allowing type specific output
operators to provide formatting. The output line in the above example
could have been written as a log message.

::

  kwiver::vital::logger_handle_t logger( kwiver::vital::get_logger( "detector_test" ));
  LOG_INFO( logger, "There were " << detections->size() << " detections in the image." );

Note that log messages do not need an end-of-line at the end.

Refer to the separate logger documentation for more details.

******************************
Detector Configuration Support
******************************

In our detector example we just used the detector in its default state
without specifying any configuration options. This works well in this
example, but there are cases and algorithms where the behaviour needs
to be modified for best results.

Vital provides a configuration package that implements a key/value
scheme for specifying configurable parameters. The config parameters
are used to control an algorithm and in later examples it can be used
to select the algorithm. The usual approach is to create a config
structure from the contents of a file, but the values can be
programatically set also. The key for a config entry has a
hierarchical format

The full details of the config file structure are available in a
separate document.

All algorithms support the methods get_confguration() and
set_configuration(). The get_confguration() method returns a structure
with the expected configuration items and default parameters. These
parameters can be changed and sent back to the algorithm with the
set_configuration() method. The hough_circle_detector, the
configuration is as follows:

::

  dp = 1
  
  Description: Inverse ratio of the accumulator resolution to the
  image resolution. For example, if dp=1 , the accumulator has the same
  resolution as the input image. If dp=2 , the accumulator has half as
  big width and height.
  
  max_radius = 0
  
  Description: Maximum circle radius.
  
  min_dist = 100
  
  Description: Minimum distance between the centers of the detected
  circles. If the parameter is too small, multiple neighbor circles may
  be falsely detected in addition to a true one. If it is too large,
  some circles may be missed.
  
  min_radius = 0
  
  Description: Minimum circle radius.
  
  param1 = 200
  
  Description: First method-specific parameter. In case of
  CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT , it is the higher threshold of the two passed to
  the Canny() edge detector (the lower one is twice smaller).
  
  param2 = 100
  
  Description: Second method-specific parameter. In case of
  CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT , it is the accumulator threshold for the circle
  centers at the detection stage. The smaller it is, the more false
  circles may be detected. Circles, corresponding to the larger
  accumulator values, will be returned first.

Lets modify the preceding detector to accept a configuration file.

::

  #include <vital/config/config_block_io.h>
  #include <arrows/ocv/image_container.h>
  #include <arrows/ocv/image_io.h>
  #include <arrows/ocv/hough_circle_detector.h>

  #include <string>

  int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
  {
    // (1) get file name for input image
    std::string filename = argv[1];

    // (2) Look for name of config file as second parameter
    kwiver::vital::config_block_sptr config;
    if ( argc > 2 )
    {
      config = kwiver::vital::read_config_file( argv[2] );
    }

    // (3) create image reader
    kwiver::vital::algo::image_io_sptr image_reader( new kwiver::arrows::ocv::image_io() );

    // (4) Read the image
    kwiver::vital::image_container_sptr the_image = image_reader->load( filename );

    // (5) Create the detector
    kwiver::vital::algo::image_object_detector_sptr detector( new kwiver::arrows::ocv::hough_circle_detector() );

    // (6) If there was a config structure, then pass it to the algorithm.
    if (config)
    {
      detector->set_configuration( config );
    }

    // (7) Send image to detector and get detections.
    kwiver::vital::detected_object_set_sptr detections = detector->detect( the_image );

    // (8) See what was detected
    std::cout << "There were " << detections->size() << " detections in the image." << std::endl;

    return 0;
  }

We have added code to handle the optional second command line
parameter in section (2). The read_config_file() function converts a
file to a configuration structure. In section (6), if a config block
has been created, it is passed to the algorithm.

The configuration file is as follows. Note that parameters that are
not specified in the file retain their default values.

::

  dp = 2
  min_dist = 120
  param1 = 100


**************************
Configurable Detector Type
**************************

To further expand on our example, the actual detector algorithm can be
selected at run time based on the contents of our config file.

::

  #include <vital/algorithm_plugin_manager.h>
  #include <vital/config/config_block_io.h>
  #include <vital/algo/image_object_detector.h>
  #include <arrows/ocv/image_container.h>
  #include <arrows/ocv/image_io.h>

  #include <string>

  int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
  {
    // (1) Create logger to use for reporting errors and other diagnostics.
    kwiver::vital::logger_handle_t logger( kwiver::vital::get_logger( "detector_test" ));

    // (2) Initialize and load all discoverable plugins
    kwiver::vital::algorithm_plugin_manager::load_plugins_once();

    // (3) get file name for input image
    std::string filename = argv[1];

    // (4) Look for name of config file as second parameter
    kwiver::vital::config_block_sptr config = kwiver::vital::read_config_file( argv[2] );

    // (5) create image reader
    kwiver::vital::algo::image_io_sptr image_reader( new kwiver::arrows::ocv::image_io() );

    // (6) Read the image
    kwiver::vital::image_container_sptr the_image = image_reader->load( filename );

    // (7) Create the detector
    kwiver::vital::algo::image_object_detector_sptr detector;
    kwiver::vital::algo::image_object_detector::set_nested_algo_configuration( "detector", config, detector );

    if ( ! detector )
    {
      LOG_ERROR( logger, "Unable to create detector" );
      return 1;
    }

    // (8) Send image to detector and get detections.
    kwiver::vital::detected_object_set_sptr detections = detector->detect( the_image );

    // (9) See what was detected
    std::cout << "There were " << detections->size() << " detections in the image." << std::endl;

    return 0;
  }


Since we are going to select the detector algorithm at run time, we no
longer need to include the hough_circle_detector header file. New code
in section (2) initializes the plugin manager which will be used to
instantiate the selected algorithm at run time. The plugin
architecture will be discussed in a following section.

The following config file will select and configure our favourite
hough_circle_detector

::

  # select detector type
  detector:type =   hough_circle_detector

  # specify configuration for selected detector
  detector:hough_circle_detector:dp =           1
  detector:hough_circle_detector:min_dist =     100
  detector:hough_circle_detector:param1 =       200
  detector:hough_circle_detector:param2 =       100
  detector:hough_circle_detector:min_radius =   0
  detector:hough_circle_detector:max_radius =   0


First you will notice that the config file entries have a longer key
specification. The ':' character separates the different levels or
blocks in the config and enable scoping of the value specifications.

The "detector" string in the config file corresponds with the
"detector" string in section (7) of the example. The "type" key for
the "detector" algorithm specifies which detector is to be used. If an
alternate detector type "foo" were to be specified, the config would
be as follows.

::

  # select detector type
  detector:type =             foo
  detector:foo:param1 =       20
  detector:foo:param2 =       10

Since the individual detector (or algorithm) parameters are
effectively in their own namespace, configurations for multiple
algorithms can be in the same file, which is exactly how more
complicated applications are configured.


***********************************************
Sequencing One or More Algorithms in a Pipeline
***********************************************

In a real application, the input images may come from places other
than a file on the disk and there may be algorithms applied to
precondition the images prior to object detection. After detection,
the detections could be overlaid on the input imagery or compared
against manual annotations.

Ideally this type of application could be structured to flow the data
from one algorithm to the next, but writing this a one monolithic
application, changes become difficult and time consuming. This is
where another component of KWIVER, sprokit, can be used to simplify
creating a larger application from smaller component algorithms.

Sprokit is the "Stream Processing Toolkit", a library aiming to make
processing a stream of data with various algorithms easy. It provides
a data flow model of application building by providing a process and
interconnect approach. An application made from several processes can be
easily specified in a pipeline configuration file.

Lets first look at an example application/pipeline that runs our
hough_circle_detector on a set of images, draws the detections on the
image and then displays the annotated image.

  # -- end of file --

Our example pipeline configuration file is made up of process
definitions and connections. The first process handles image input and
uses a configuration style we saw in the description of selectable
algorithms, to select an "ocv" reader algorithm. The next process is
the detector, followed by the process that composites the detections
and the image. The last process displays the annotated image.
The connections section specify how the inputs and outputs of these
processes are connected.

This pipeline can then be run using the 'kwiver runner ' app
