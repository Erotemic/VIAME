===========================
Scripts and Example Folders
===========================

In the 'examples' folder of a desktop installation, there are a number of subfolders, with each folder
corresponding to a different major functionality of VIAME. The scripts in each of these folders can
be run as-is in each folder, or alternatively copied, edited, and run from any directory on your computer.
Each script calls a command line interface (CLI) executable to perform some function. The alternative to
running CLI tools, is to run algorithms through graphical user interfaces within VIAME, such as DIVE
(see annotation and visualization). Lastly, project folders provide multiple scripts in one location
for different stages of an object-detector-training lifecycle for users who prefer using them.

To run the examples on Windows, you need to be able to run (double click) the .bat scripts in the given
directories (see image below). Additionally, knowing how to make a list of files, e.g. 'dir > filename.txt'
on the windows command line can possibly be useful for processing custom image lists.

To run the examples on Linux, there are 3 core commands you need to know:

'bash' - for running commands, e.g. 'bash run_annotation_gui.sh' which launches the application

'ls' - for making file lists of images to process, e.g. 'ls *.png > input_list.txt' to list all
png image files in a folder

'cd' - go into an example directory, e.g. 'cd annotation_and_visualization' to move down into the
annotation_and_visualization example directory. 'cd ..' is another useful command which moves one
directory up, alongside a lone 'ls' command to list all files in the current directory.

***************
Editing Scripts
***************

All scripts can be opened and edited in any text editor to adjust script options. On window, 
the script can be right-clicked and then 'Edit' can be selected to open it in the default
windows text editor (Notepad).

For example, one of the most common values that requires editing is the 'VIAME_INSTALL' path at
the top of each run script. This is useful if copying and running any scripts outside of
project folders or the example directories. The VIAME_INSTALL path should point to the location
of your installed (or compiled) binaries. In the case of installers, this is the top level 'VIAME'
folder. In the case of manual software builds, this would be the 'install' directory within a
build tree.

Other common options are 'INPUT_FOLDER', a directory containing multiple input videos or images,
and 'DEFAULT_FRAME_RATE', the default frames per second to run algorithms on if the input is
a video instead of images.

***********************
Bulk Processing Scripts
***********************

Each .sh or .bat script in the example folder is designed to run on either a single sequence
of data (e.g. one video, one image sequence, or one image list) or alternatively a folder
or folder of folders containing many sequences. Inside each script is either a call to
'process_video' (the most common default), 'viame_train_detector', or the 'kwiver' executable.
The first two are meant for bulk processing multiple sequences, while the latter only
processes a single sequence.

Depending on the scripts, inputs may just be raw data (images or video), raw data plus
annotation files (.csv, .json), or raw data plus metadata and annotations. In the default
case, you can have any number of videos in the input folder, or image folders containing
multiple images. For example:

input_folder    <-- root folder
  - video1.mpg
  - video2.mpg
  - sequence3   <-- subfolder
  - - image1.png
  - - image2.png
  - - image3.png
  - - etc...

Images and videos can optionally be mixed in the same input folder.

Alternatively, the input folder can just be a folder of images:

input_folder    <-- root folder
  - image1.png
  - image2.png
  - image3.png
  - etc...

Or just videos:

input_folder    <-- root folder
  - video1.mpg
  - video2.mpg

Annotation files can provide either metadata (e.g. the FPS to process videos at, different
on a per-video basis) or boxes/categories for training different types of AI models.
For cases that require annotation files alongside videos, they should be in the same
directory as the video with the same name, except instead of the video extension it should
be a .csv or .json file. For image sequences, there should be a single annotation file of
any name in the folder of images. Alternatively, an annotation file as the same name as
the input image sequence folder can be placed at the same directory level of the folder.

For example:

input_folder    <-- root folder
  - video1.mpg
  - video1.csv
  - video2.mpg
  - video2.csv
  - sequence3   <-- subfolder
  - - image1.png
  - - image2.png
  - - image3.png
  - - whatever.csv

is a valid input

input_folder    <-- root folder
  - video1.mpg
  - video1.json
  - video2.mpg
  - video2.json
  - sequence3.json
  - sequence3   <-- subfolder
  - - image1.png
  - - image2.png
  - - image3.png

is also a valid input

input_folder    <-- root folder
  - video1.mpg
  - video1.json
  - video2.mpg
  - video2.json
  - sequence3   <-- subfolder
  - - image1.png
  - - image2.png
  - - image3.png
  - - truth1.json
  - - truth2.json

is not a valid input, as the image folder contains two possible truth files, and that
will confuse the input loader. An input folder without a truth file will also error out
with a hard error.

**********************************
Scripts vs Direct Executable Calls
**********************************

All of the scripts within examples or project folders call the following exectuables under
the hood. These can be called by more advanced users. Running '-?' or '-help' on each script
shows a list of all potential options.

process_video.py - bulk runs a particular algorithmic pipeline on multiple files

kwiver - runs a single pipeline on multiple files

any of the python scripts in the configs directory - contain specialized functionality
such as running camera calibration, generating mosaics, or running algorithm evaluation
code, all in standalone scripts

viame_train_detector - Independent CLI tool for training models


===============
Project Folders
===============

The 'examples' folder is one of two core entry points into running VIAME functionality. The other is
to copy project files for your operating system, '[install]/configs/prj-linux' or
'[install]/configs/prj-windows' to a directory of your choice and run things from there. Not all
functionality is in the default project file scripts, however, but it is a good entry point if you
just want to get started on object detection and/or tracking.
